# Relational databases
Originaly created as a way to efficiently store large amounts of data. There are ways in R to access these databases.

## Methods
1) DBI ('DBI')
2) dplyr ('dplyr', 'dbplyr')
3) R Notebooks

any of these approaches you must connect to an external database

This opens a connection to a database
```{r, eval=FALSE}
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), dsn = "Source Name")
```

You can use dplyr syntax! With the connection as the first input to the chunck.

RNotebooks can allow for SQL directly as a differnet code chunk.

Can access MS Access via R too.

# Some notes on multivariate analysis
PERMANOVA! 'adonis()' and 'adonis2()'

## Steps in Analysis
1) Transformations and standardizations
  + transformations changes the shape of the distribution
  + strandardizations do not change the shape but scales the values to some level
  + transformation to achive normality is NOT necessary for many/all multivariate analyses. It just depends on hte situation.
  + Standarizations are almost alwayse a good idea
2) Compute pairwise dissimilarities using an *appropriate* measure
  + for sp composition data bary-curtis is the most appropriate becasue it can handle zeros
  + euclidean is highly affected by zeros, as long as things are reasonably normal
  + lost of other distance measures
3) Ordination to visualize differences
4) Interpret the ordination in terms of the data, e.g. species composition
5) Relate the ordination to environmental variables
  + envifit()
  + Mantel test bioenv() in vegan
