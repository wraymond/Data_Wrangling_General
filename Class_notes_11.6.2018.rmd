# Oceanographic data
The `oce` package has a bunch of tools for dealing with oceanographic data and some other weather/climate data.

# Morphometrics
`geomorph` package

# Cross-correlations for time series analysis
`ccf()` the cross-correlations function

Somtimes you may not know what is causing the lag. Is a causing b or b causing a? This can be an issue when building predictive models

# Cautionary tale
Patterns and correlations do not necesarily mean anything
